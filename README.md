# Canvas LMS misc utilities
This repo contains some Canvas utility functions such as:
- [x] Automatically adding groups based on `.txt` section roster and the `.csv` course roster.
- [ ] Add an argument parser to customize the group name.
- [ ] Automatically sorting the bulk downloaded submission pdfs for Gradescope.

## Auto-group instructions
The script for this function is `auto_group.py`. Please put the script in the same folder with (1) your course roster generated by the Canvas Group function, (2) the section rosters (preferably tabbed `.txt` files). 


In the download roster option on WebFac, please mark the Section checkbox:

![Download roster](./roster_selection.png)

So that the `.txt` file can have a Section column to the `auto_group.py` script to recognize. The default naming of the Groups is `Section X` where `X` is the retried text from the Section column. 

Then on Canvas, go to `People` tab, click `+ Group set`:

![Download course csv](./group_generation.png)

After creating the Groups, click `+ Import` you will see a menu as follows:

![Download course csv](./course_roster.png)

Download the `csv` file generated, and put the `txt` rosters of sub-sections in the same folder with this `auto_group.py` script.

Now run the following command in the command line tool (PowerShell on Windows 10 or Terminal on MacOS) in the very folder of everything:
```python
python3 auto_group.py
```
to generate a processed course roster of which you can use to import the Groups.
